Task: Implement a function with the following type signature in Agda:

thm : ∀ s m → isFinished (update s m) → ⊥

Current Agda code:

open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality
open import Relation.Nullary

open import Data.Product
open import Data.Empty
open import Data.List
open import Data.Unit
open import Data.Nat


fst⊥ : ∀ {A : Set} → ⊥ × A → ⊥ 
fst⊥ = proj₁

snd⊥ : ∀ {A : Set} → A × ⊥ → ⊥ 
snd⊥ = proj₂

elim⊥ : ∀ {A : Set} → ⊥ → A 
elim⊥ = λ ()


data State : Set where
 uninitialized : State
 counting : ℕ → State
 finished : State

data Msg : Set where
 initialize : ℕ → Msg
 increment : Msg

isFinished : State → Set
isFinished uninitialized = ⊥
isFinished (counting x) = ⊥
isFinished finished = ⊤

update : State → Msg → State
update uninitialized (initialize x) = counting x
update uninitialized increment = uninitialized
update (counting x) (initialize x₁) = counting x
update (counting x) increment = counting (suc x)
update finished x₁ = uninitialized

Please provide the exact Agda code that I need to append to the existing code to implement the function according to the given type signature. please always put only code beetwen "```". 

from this momemn, I will always append your code to my code, please reemeber about this, this is important.

Do not duplicate my code, always print only the code that I need to add at the end of already existing code.

While helping me, you need to output only code that should be appended to my code, do not repat my code  to me.


Hi GPT, I tried implementing the function using the code you provided, but I encountered some errors during compilation. 

The compiler reported the following errors:

Checking AGA-M (/home/kryn/tt/agda-gpt-assistant/agda-gpt-assistant/data/tests/AGA-M.agda).
/home/kryn/tt/agda-gpt-assistant/agda-gpt-assistant/data/tests/AGA-M.agda:42,37-38
(isFinished (update uninitialized m)) !=< (Σ ⊥ (λ x₁ → _A_37))
when checking that the expression x has type ⊥ × _A_37


I need you to output ONLY code that I will append to my initial code, DO NOT print whole surce. This is really important.

Do not duplicate my code, always print only the code that I need to add at the end of code that i showed you at the begining of conversation, this is really important to me.



Thanks!

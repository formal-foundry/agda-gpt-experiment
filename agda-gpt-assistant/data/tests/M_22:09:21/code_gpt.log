Task: Implement a function with the following type signature in Agda:

thm : ∀ s m → isFinished (update s m) → ⊥

Current Agda code:

open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality
open import Relation.Nullary

open import Data.Product
open import Data.Empty
open import Data.List
open import Data.Unit
open import Data.Nat


fst⊥ : ∀ {A : Set} → ⊥ × A → ⊥ 
fst⊥ = proj₁

snd⊥ : ∀ {A : Set} → A × ⊥ → ⊥ 
snd⊥ = proj₂

elim⊥ : ∀ {A : Set} → ⊥ → A 
elim⊥ = λ ()


data State : Set where
 uninitialized : State
 counting : ℕ → State
 finished : State

data Msg : Set where
 initialize : ℕ → Msg
 increment : Msg

isFinished : State → Set
isFinished uninitialized = ⊥
isFinished (counting x) = ⊥
isFinished finished = ⊤

update : State → Msg → State
update uninitialized (initialize x) = counting x
update uninitialized increment = uninitialized
update (counting x) (initialize x₁) = counting x
update (counting x) increment = counting (suc x)
update finished x₁ = uninitialized

Please provide the exact Agda code that I need to append to the existing code to implement the function according to the given type signature. please always put only code beetwen "```". 

from this momemn, I will always append your code to my code, please reemeber about this, this is important.

Do not duplicate my code, always print only the code that I need to add at the end of already existing code.

thm : ∀ s m → isFinished (update s m) → ⊥
thm s m p = case s , m of 
  uninitialized , increment => p 
  uninitialized , initialize x => p
  counting n , increment => ⊥-elim p
  counting n , initialize x => p 
  finished , increment => ⊥-elim p 
  finished , initialize x => ⊥-elim p

While helping me, you need to output only code that should be appended to my code, do not repat my code  to me.


Hi GPT, I tried implementing the function using the code you provided, but I encountered some errors during compilation. 

The compiler reported the following errors:

Checking AGA-M (/home/kryn/tt/agda-gpt-assistant/agda-gpt-assistant/data/tests/AGA-M.agda).
/home/kryn/tt/agda-gpt-assistant/agda-gpt-assistant/data/tests/AGA-M.agda:42,13-17
Not in scope:
  case

when scope checking case


I need you to output ONLY code that I will append to my initial code, DO NOT print whole surce. This is really important.

Do not duplicate my code, always print only the code that I need to add at the end of code that i showed you at the begining of conversation, this is really important to me.



Thanks!

thm : ∀ s m → isFinished (update s m) → ⊥
thm s m p with s | m
... | uninitialized | increment = p
... | uninitialized | initialize x = p
... | counting n | increment = ⊥-elim p
... | counting n | initialize x = p
... | finished | increment = ⊥-elim p
... | finished | initialize x = ⊥-elim p
